# In this exercise are different types of variables explained

a = 'int'
b = 7
c = False
d = "18.5"
e = 18.5
#a is a string as the array of characters is between ""
#b is an Integer as the number has no digits behind the comma
#c is a boolean as it has a value of False (or true for that matter)
#d is a string as the array of characters is between ""
#e is actually a float as it is a number with digits behind the comma

variabele_x=float(b)+float(d)
print(variabele_x)

# with the command float, the integer (in this case "b") becomes a float.

variabele_y=float(b)+(e)
print(variabele_y)

variabele_z=(b+e)
print(variabele_z)

# Here you can see that an integer together with a float gives a result in a float.
